            <div class="md-2">We will only collect and process your personal data where we have lawful grounds to do
                so.
            </div>
            <div class="md-2">We will update our records if you inform us that your details have changed. Please tell us
                (see contact details above) as soon as possible about this. We will update our records promptly once we

            <div class="md-2"><strong>DATA RETENTION</strong></div>
            <div class="md-2">We will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfil our

                necessary for its purpose.
            </div>
            <div class="md-2">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount,
                nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk, harm of unauthorised use or disclosure
                of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
                those purposes through other means, including applicable legal requirements.
            </div>
            <div class="md-2">Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available
                upon request. By law, we have to keep certain information about our customers and this data will be held
                solely and securely for those legal purposes.

            <div class="md-2"><strong>DATA SECURITY</strong></div>
            <div class="md-2">We are committed to ensuring the security of your personal data.</div>
            <div class="md-2">In accordance with our obligations under Data Protection Laws, to prevent unauthorised
                access to our disclosure of your personal data (including card payments), maintain data accuracy, and
                ensure the appropriate use of your personal data, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic,
                and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal data we collect online.
            </div>
            <div class="md-2">However, you acknowledge that, unfortunately, the transmission of information via the
                internet, including the online enquiry forms you submit to us and/or any information provided on

            <div class="md-2"><strong>YOUR RIGHTS&nbsp;</strong></div>
            <div class="md-2">You have the following rights (which may not always apply or be subject to certain
                circumstances and exemptions, and some only apply from 25 May 2018):
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>right to be informed&nbsp;</strong>- including about Our processing of Your personal
                    data. That is the reason for this data protection statement.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>To have Your personal data <strong>corrected if it is inaccurate&nbsp;</strong>and to have
                    <strong>incomplete
                        personal data completed&nbsp;</strong>in certain circumstances.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>The right in some cases <strong>to object&nbsp;</strong>to processing of Your personal data (as
                    relevant). This right allows individuals in certain circumstances to object to processing based on
                    legitimate interests, direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for purposes of
                    statistics.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>The right in some cases <strong>to restrict processing&nbsp;</strong>of Your personal data, for
                    instance where You contest it as being inaccurate (until the accuracy is verified); where You
                    consider that the processing is unlawful and where this the case; and where You request that Our use
                    of it is restricted; or where We no longer need the personal data.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>The right <strong>to have Your personal data erased&nbsp;</strong>in certain circumstances (also
                    known as the <em>right to be forgotten</em>). This right is not absolute &ndash; it applies only in
                    particular circumstances and where it does not apply any request for erasure will be rejected.
                    Circumstances when it might apply include where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation
                    to the purpose for which it was originally collected/processed, if the processing is based on
                    consent which You then withdraw, when there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the
                    processing, if the personal data is unlawfully processed, or if the personal data has to be erased
                    to comply with a legal obligation. Requests for erasure will be refused where that is lawful and
                    permitted under data protection law for instance where the personal data has to be retained to
                    comply with legal obligations or to exercise or defend legal claims.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>To <strong>request access&nbsp;</strong>to the personal data held about You and to obtain certain
                    prescribed information about how We process it. This is more commonly known as submitting a data
                    subject access request. This must be done in writing, and we may need confirmation of your identity.
                    This right will enable You to obtain confirmation that Your personal data is being processed, to
                    obtain access to it, and to obtain other supplementary information about how it is processed. In
                    this way You can be aware of and You can verify the lawfulness of your processing of Your personal
                    data.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>To move, copy or transfer certain personal data. Also known as <strong>data portability</strong>.
                    You can do this where We are processing Your personal data based on a consent or a contract and by
                    automated means. This right is different from the right of access (see above) and that the types of
                    data You can obtain under the two separate rights may be different. You are not able to obtain
                    through the data portability right all of the personal data that You can obtain through the right of
                    access.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>Rights in relation to some <strong>automated decision making&nbsp;</strong>about You including
                    profiling (as relevant) if this has a legal or other significant effect on You as an individual.
                    This right allows individuals in certain circumstances to access certain safeguards against the risk
                    that a potentially damaging decision is taken without human intervention.&nbsp;For more information
                    or to exercise these rights, please contact Us using the details at the end of this policy.&nbsp;You
                    have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office where Your data
                    has or is being used in a way that You believe does not comply with data protection laws. However,
                    We encourage You to contact Us before making any complaint and we will seek to resolve any issues or
                    concerns You may have.&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="md-2"><strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></div>
            <div class="md-2">Any changes to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted to our sites and, where
                appropriate, through e-mail notification. This Privacy Policy was last updated Monday 5<sup>th</sup>
