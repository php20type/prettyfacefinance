                The credit is only suitable for the purchase of goods and services that you have selected from the retailer
                and is not suitable for any other purpose.

                should consider whether your circumstances are likely to change in the future which might impact on your
                ability to make repayments. If you think that they may do so, then you should not enter into the Agreement.

            <div class="mb-2">
                If you do give us notice of withdrawal and we have paid out the credit on your behalf to the retailer, you
                must repay to Snap Finance the Amount of Credit due, including any interest incurred at the daily rate set
                out in your Credit Agreement, without delay. In any event, by no later than 30 Calendar Days after giving
                notice of withdrawal.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2">
                You may repay the Amount of Credit early, either in part or in full, by giving Snap Finance notice in
                writing or orally of your intention to do so. You can do this by contacting Snap either by post to 1 Vincent
                Avenue, Crownhill, Milton Keynes, MK8 0AB. Or by telephone on 03300 109381 by paying the appropriate amount,
                which may include a rebate.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2">
                If you repay the amount of credit early, in part, they may reduce the amount of the repayments due from you
                or alternatively, may reduce the duration of the agreement. Your partial payment will be applied firstly to
                pay off any arrears, late payment interest and charges to bring Your account up to date and the remainder
                will be applied to partially settle Your account.

            <div class="mb-2">
                <u>Continuous Payment Authority (CPA)</u>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2">
                A Continuous Payment Authority (CPA), which is sometimes referred to as a recurring payment or a ‘continuous
                payment transaction’, is where you give Snap Finance permission to take money from your debit or credit card
                whenever Snap Finance believes it’s owed money. A CPA is different from a standing order or Direct Debit
                because the payment instruction is with us, not with your bank.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2">
                This gives Snap Finance more flexibility in taking money from your account but only if we are unable to take
                your loan payment by direct debit. As a responsible lender, they use Continuous Payment Authority in a
                manner which is reasonable, proportionate and not excessive. They always strive to exercise appropriate
                forbearance if they become aware that you are, or may be, experiencing financial difficulties. They only use
                it to collect money owed to them as agreed in the loan agreement. The only amount that can be attempted is
                the agreed repayment amount or an alternative amount agreed with you. You can reinstate the CPA attempts or
                change the requested amount by contacting them at any time.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2">
                The FCA have strict guidelines on how CPA is used. A maximum of two CPA attempts per agreed repayment can be
                made to a customer account. If the first repayment transaction fails, then they will make a further attempt
                on the following day to make sure they have not missed your salary or benefit deposit. If the total agreed
                repayment amount could not be debited under both agreed attempts for repayment, no further attempts to debit
                payment under CPA will be made to collect that particular payment. Remember though, it is still your
                responsibility to repay your loan! You can reinstate your CPA or request for your payment to be debited over
                the phone.
